Assignment 3 - JS Problems

    All problems should be submitted in one file like index.js with every solution as a function e.g. problem 1 can have function solution1(){ your code } . ** marked problem are most important.
1). Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7.

2). Write a JavaScript program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit.

    [ Formula : c/5 = (f-32)/9 [ where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in Fahrenheit ]
    Expected Output :
    60°C is 140 °F
    45°F is 7.222222222222222°C
3). Write a JavaScript program to find the largest of three given integers.

4). Write a JavaScript program to capitalize the first letter of each word of a given string.
